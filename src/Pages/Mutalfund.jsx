          Investments in Mutual Funds can be broadly classified into two types-
          lumpsum and SIP. A lumpsum investment is when the depositor invests a
          significant sum of money on a particular mutual fund scheme. SIP or
          Systematic Investment Plan, on the other hand, entails the investment
          of smaller amounts on a monthly basis.

          returns are generally on the higher side. To find out the estimated
          returns on your lumpsum mutual fund investment, you may use a mutual

        <h6 className="container">
          All lumpsum calculator mutual fund uses a specific method to compute
          the estimated return on investment. It is essentially a compound
          interest formula with one of the variables being the number of times
          the interest is compounded in a year.
        </h6>
        <h6>The Formula is as follows:</h6>
        <h6 className="container">A = P (1 + r/n) ^ nt</h6>
        <h6>The variables are mentioned in the table below.</h6>

        <div className="container">
          <h6>A: Estimated return</h6>
          <h6>P: Present Value</h6>
          <h6>r: Rate of Return</h6>

          <h6>n: Number of Independent</h6>

             For example, imagine investing Rs. 15 Lakh in a fund
            with a 12% return for 5-year period compounding every 6 months. <br/>
             The
            estimated return in this scenario will be- A = Rs. 15, 00,000 (1 +
            12%) ^ 5 As you can surmise, itâ€™s a complex equation which may be
            out of grasp for a majority of investors.
            <br/>A lumpsum MF calculator
            will calculate it instantly. In this case, your estimated return at
